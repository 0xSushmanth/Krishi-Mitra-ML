# Krishi-Mitra-ML

Krishi-Mitra-ML is a machine learning-based solution for precision agriculture that utilizes a Random Forest Classifier. 
This solution is designed to provide farmers with accurate crop recommendations based on soil characteristics, weather conditions, and crop yield data, enabling them to make informed decisions for optimal crop cultivation practices.

## Krishi-Mitra-API

Krishi-Mitra-API is a Flask-based API for the Krishi-Mitra-ML project. 
It provides endpoints for making predictions using the trained Random Forest Classifier model. 
You can find the code and documentation for Krishi-Mitra-API in the [Krishi-Mitra-API repository](https://github.com/0xSushmanth/Krishi-Mitra-API).


## DISCLAIMER ⚠️
This is a POC(Proof of concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes up with no guarantee from the creator. So, don't use it for making farming decisions. If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use ML/DL into precision farming if developed at large scale and with authentic and verified data.
